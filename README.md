# Timeline
A Java GUI application for building an interactive history timeline.   

Planned Updates: 
- Provide functionality for multiple events in each year.  Using an array of linked lists containing events and maybe a JTabbedPane interface?
- Allow for photos to be aquired from anywhere and automatically copied into the main directory that the application uses.

Bugs:
Can't copy and paste into the JtextFields or JTextAreas

## To Build:

    git clone https://github.com/tatterdemalione/Timeline.git
    cd Timeline
    javac *.class

## To Test:

    cd ..			# To move out of the Timeline Folder
    java Timeline.timelineGUI
