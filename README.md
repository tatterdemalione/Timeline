# Timeline
A Java GUI application for building an interactive history timeline.  This application lets you build your own timeline, adding information and images that interest you!

Planned Updates: 
- Provide functionality for multiple events in each year.  Using an array of linked lists containing events and maybe a JTabbedPane interface?
- Put a logo on the main screen
- Add .jar build instructions for Mac and Windows
- Add a backup feature

## Bugs:
- Can't copy and paste into the JtextFields or JTextAreas
- Large photos get cropped in an ugly fashion, instead of reduced in size...

## Install (Mac): 
    Move into the directory you want save the file in using terminal
        git clone https://github.com/tatterdemalione/Timeline.git
        sh build.sh  #creates a jar folder that can be executed directly
        double click the .jar file to run the app

Warning: Do not edit any of the files in the Timelines folder outside of the application because it is easy to break things.
