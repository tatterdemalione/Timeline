# Timeline
A Java GUI application for building an interactive history timeline.  
Changes needed: 
  - Create functionality for when a user wants a timeline that starts before year 0 and goes back in time. 
  - Allow for multiple events to be shown for each year. Use a linked list of events for each index in the main timeline array
