# Timeline
A Java GUI application for building an interactive history timeline.    
  
Bugs:
- 
Planned Updates: 
- Provide functionality for multiple events in each year.  Using an array of linked lists containing events and maybe a JTabbedPane interface?
- Allow for photos to be aquired from anywhere and automatically copied into the main directory that the application uses.
